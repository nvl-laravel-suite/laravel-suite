# Installation profiles

Installation profiles are reproducible runtime module selections, not hidden
modes. New installations default to `full-suite`. Consumers can keep a small
Laravel configuration overlay while the suite resolves all transitive
dependencies in canonical order:

```bash
php artisan nvl:suite:configure --profile=content-platform --minimal
php artisan nvl:suite:configure --profile=content-platform --minimal --write
php artisan config:clear
```

`nvl:suite:configure` is dry-run-first and always prints the generated PHP.
`--minimal` emits only `profile`, `include`, and `exclude`; `--full` emits all
twenty-two resolved module booleans and remains the default for command
compatibility. Use repeatable `--add` options for capability roots and
`--remove` only for modules that no retained root requires. For example:

```bash
php artisan nvl:suite:configure --profile=auth-only --add=comments --remove=forms --minimal
```

The command writes only with `--write`. A new destination is written
atomically. Replacing an existing file additionally requires `--force`, and the
command returns a unified diff for review. An actual replacement creates an
exact sibling backup named `nvl-suite.php.backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`; a dry run,
new file, or already-matching file creates no backup. Destinations must be
readable `.php` files inside the application root; symlink escapes are rejected.

At runtime, a non-null legacy `modules` map remains authoritative. Otherwise,
the suite resolves `profile`, then `include`, validates `exclude`, and closes
dependencies. The upgrade checker rejects a host file that mixes the legacy map
with declarative keys, even though runtime keeps the legacy map authoritative
for backward compatibility. In a legacy map, omitted module flags resolve to
disabled in 2.0; an explicitly enabled root still re-enables its transitive
dependencies. Minimal overlays work identically with cached and uncached
Laravel configuration.

Compare the booted application with the selected profile after configuring
migration ownership, contracts, registries, queues, and schedules:

```bash
php artisan nvl:suite:configuration --profile=content-platform
php artisan nvl:suite:doctor --strict
```

The configuration command reports `MATCH` only when the effective enabled
module set equals the dependency-complete profile. Its
`package_configuration` section also reports structural drift in published
package configuration files. It never prints arbitrary configuration values or
secrets.

Publish the skills for that same effective module set and verify their
read-only ownership/content contract with:

```bash
php artisan nvl:suite:skills:publish
php artisan nvl:suite:skills:doctor --strict
```

The publisher manages only directories recorded in
`.agents/skills/.nvl-suite-skills.json`. It never replaces an unmanaged skill,
even when `--force` is used.

## Upgrade and audit gate

Before changing the suite version, run the published configuration through the
current catalog and audit application source/runtime boundaries:

```bash
php artisan nvl:suite:upgrade:check --strict
php artisan nvl:suite:upgrade:check --strict --module=auth --module=comments
php artisan nvl:suite:consumer-audit --strict
```

The upgrade checker is read-only. It reports missing, unknown, and non-boolean
module decisions and lists the migration ownership, host contracts, and
feature-gated scheduler entries that need review for newly encountered modules.
It also tokenizes published package configuration source without loading or
executing it. The comparison retains only literal key paths and basic
map/list/scalar kinds; catalog-declared extension maps stop recursion so
consumer-owned aliases remain valid. `--module` limits this package-configuration
inspection without changing the application module selection.

Unknown or deprecated key paths and an incorrect package merge strategy are
errors. A copied snapshot-shaped file produces
`configuration.expanded_overlay`, and missing current branches are then listed
for review. Those findings are warnings: even with `--strict`, warnings alone do
not fail the command. A small overlay that declares only intentional host
choices is valid and does not warn for omitted defaults. Neither command prints
arbitrary configuration values or secrets.

Both commands use stable process outcomes: exit `0` means the requested gate
passed, exit `1` means actionable adoption or boundary findings remain, and
exit `2` means the arguments, destination, configuration source, or audit policy
is invalid.

Suite 2.0 disables every omitted flag in a non-null legacy `modules` map. Before
upgrading a partial 1.x map, generate the replacement with a reviewed profile:

```bash
php artisan nvl:suite:configure --profile=full-suite --full
php artisan nvl:suite:configure --profile=full-suite --full --write --force
```

Use the narrower documented profile that matches the consumer when the old
omissions were intentional. The full-suite profile preserves the 1.x
compatibility-enabled behavior. Review every generated boolean and the unified
diff before writing. `nvl:suite:upgrade:check` reports one
`upgrade.module_missing` error per omission, including its requested-disabled
state, its actual effective enabled/disabled 2.0 state after dependency closure,
and this remediation. The legacy
`adoption.require_explicit_module_decisions` setting may remain during the
upgrade, but omitted flags are now intentional disabled states rather than
strict Doctor warnings. See [UPGRADING.md](../UPGRADING.md) for the exact
before/after configuration.

## Auth only

Enable `auth`.

| Concern | Adoption requirement |
|---|---|
| Effective modules | `support`, `data`, `auth` |
| Migrations | Choose package-owned or published application-owned Auth migrations before migrating. |
| Required boundary | Review the resolved `AuthManagementAccess` and every enabled Auth feature contract reported by `nvl:auth:doctor`. |
| Queues and scheduler | No mandatory queue or scheduler. `nvl:auth:prune` is an optional host-owned daily maintenance entry. |
| Verification | `nvl:suite:configuration --profile=auth-only`, `nvl:auth:doctor --strict`, then `nvl:suite:doctor --strict` |

## Content platform

Enable `pages`, `taxonomy`, `templates`, and `translations`.

| Concern | Adoption requirement |
|---|---|
| Effective modules | `support`, `data`, `filterable`, `translatable`, `media`, `content`, `metafields`, `seo`, `taxonomy`, `templates`, `translations`, `pages` |
| Migrations | Choose ownership once for Media, Content, Metafields, SEO, Taxonomy, Templates, Translations, and Pages. Translation rows remain owned by each domain schema. |
| Required boundaries | Review Media, Content, Metafields, SEO, Templates, Translations, and Pages implementations plus every registered owner/resource alias. |
| Queues and scheduler | Configure template-rendering and Media conversion queues when used. Schedule multipart pruning only when multipart uploads are enabled; sitemap warming, redirect pruning, and render recovery are optional host operations. |
| Verification | `nvl:suite:configuration --profile=content-platform`, `nvl:suite:doctor --strict`, and `nvl:data:types:check` |

## Communications

Enable `auth`, `forms`, `mail-notifications`, `templates`, and `translations`.

| Concern | Adoption requirement |
|---|---|
| Effective modules | `support`, `data`, `filterable`, `translatable`, `auth`, `mail-notifications`, `media`, `content`, `templates`, `translations`, `forms` |
| Migrations | Choose ownership once for Auth, Mail Notifications, Media, Content, Templates, Translations, and Forms. |
| Required boundaries | Review Auth management, mail-history reads, scheduled-mail reads, Media, Content, Templates, Translations, and Forms security contracts. Register provider, notifiable, scheduled-message, form-handler, renderer, and owner aliases before cutover. |
| Queues and scheduler | Configure mail delivery, template rendering, Media conversions, and any host-selected form callbacks. When scheduled mail is enabled, both processing and recovery commands are mandatory scheduler entries. |
| Verification | `nvl:suite:configuration --profile=communications`, `nvl:suite:doctor --strict`, and a real queue-worker delivery smoke test |

## Full suite

Keep all twenty-two module flags enabled.

| Concern | Adoption requirement |
|---|---|
| Effective modules | Every module in the [adoption matrix](adoption-matrix.md) |
| Migrations | Decide package-owned versus application-owned migrations independently for every stateful module; never run both ownership modes. |
| Required boundaries | Replace or explicitly configure every host boundary shown by `nvl:suite:configuration`; enabled management routes must have real authorization. |
| Queues and scheduler | Configure the application queues used by enabled capabilities and install every feature-gated mandatory scheduler entry reported by the strict Doctor. |
| Verification | `nvl:suite:configuration --profile=full-suite`, `nvl:suite:doctor --production --strict`, `nvl:data:types:check`, queue-worker smoke tests, and the application's full test suite |

## Production sequence

Run the effective report before deployment and the aggregate Doctor after the
final cached configuration, routes, migrations, and scheduler have been loaded:

```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan nvl:suite:configuration --format=json
php artisan nvl:suite:skills:doctor --strict --format=json
php artisan nvl:suite:doctor --production --strict --format=json
```

The production Doctor fails for package Doctor failures, invalid migration
ownership flags, missing required feature-gated scheduler entries, debug mode,
or a missing application key. Package Doctors remain authoritative for schema,
authorization, registry, storage, queue, and unsafe-default checks.
