# Suite adoption matrix

This matrix is the suite-wide consumption checklist. The executable equivalent
is `php artisan nvl:suite:configuration`; production readiness is verified by
`php artisan nvl:suite:doctor --production --strict`.

`Package/application` means the consumer must select exactly one migration
ownership mode. `Domain` means the package supplies translation behavior while
the owning domain supplies its translation table. Optional scheduler entries
are operational recommendations; feature-gated entries marked required are
enforced when their feature is enabled.

## Consumer boundary doctrine

- **Allowed:** Actions, explicit services, contracts, DTOs, enums, owner traits, and documented identity/result models.
- **Prohibited in 2.0:** Consumer-initiated package model queries and relation aggregates are errors in 2.0.
- **Forbidden:** Consumer writes through package models, builders, raw tables, pivots, or storage paths.
- **Explicit exceptions:** Filterable consumer builders, Translatable opted-in scopes, adoption migrations, and documented legacy bridges.

Adoption selects module ownership and operations; it never grants permission to
bypass these package boundaries. Package-documented facades remain adapters to
allowed Actions or explicit services.

Generate the complete module map and validate it before each upgrade:

```bash
php artisan nvl:suite:configure --profile=content-platform
php artisan nvl:suite:configure --profile=content-platform --write
php artisan nvl:suite:upgrade:check --strict
php artisan nvl:suite:consumer-audit --strict
```

The first command is a non-mutating preview. The second is the only command here
that writes, and it atomically replaces the selected in-application PHP config.
The two checks are read-only. They exit `0` when no finding is blocking, exit
`1` only when a finding is blocking under that command policy, and exit `2` for
invalid input or policy. Consumer-audit errors are always blocking;
`consumer.implicit_module_decision` can become blocking under `--strict` when
explicit decisions are required. The advisory warning
`consumer.package_migration_reference` remains advisory and visible without
changing the exit code. Before leaving 1.x, render and review the complete
module map, then set `adoption.require_explicit_module_decisions=true`. In 2.0,
an omitted key in a published legacy module map is requested-disabled unless an
explicit root enables it through dependency closure.

## Reading the effective report

The configuration command intentionally exposes only allowlisted operational
metadata:

- requested, dependency-enabled, and disabled modules;
- loaded provider classes;
- migration ownership mode and the ownership flag name;
- resolved boundary implementation class names;
- registry alias names and Eloquent morph aliases;
- queue responsibilities, scheduler conditions, and registration status;
- TypeScript participation and Doctor command names.

It never dumps the configuration repository, callback values, credentials,
tokens, encryption keys, webhook secrets, mail payloads, or stored metadata.

### Tenancy readiness

Tenancy's stateful/database-tested classification does not enable migrations by
default. Package-owned opt-in migrations and published application-owned copies
are mutually exclusive. The core schema/adoption proof runs on PostgreSQL 17,
MySQL 8.4 and MariaDB 12.3 with the selected engine, plus SQLite.

Selected/loaded providers, enabled feature, resource ownership and adoption state
are reported separately. Loaded stateful packages without their real family and
adoption integration are incompatible with enabled tenant operation. CSV supports
an adoption-only integration with zero resources; Translatable remains owner-driven.
An incomplete composition may boot Unresolved for platform bootstrap and Doctor,
but tenant entry and adoption activation fail closed. No downstream integration
is implied by adding its provider or Composer library.

F8 verifies a minimal archived Tenancy consumer with only Support/Data and its
declared external runtime dependencies: package discovery, cached configuration,
read-only Doctor and disabled/no-schema compatibility. A separate consumer
explicitly requires Filterable and verifies caller-owned query isolation.
TypeScript source registration participates in discovery; it does not promise
client mutation DTOs for tenant ownership. Domain adoption remains separate.

Content/Sites adoption is a dependency-closed operation: adopt `media`,
`content`, `metafields`, `seo`, then `pages`, plus every consumer owner/resource
family. Content definitions remain platform code vocabulary. Public HTTP must
run `ResolvePublicTenant` before route binding. Non-HTTP publication must enter
`TenantRunner` with a host-verified `TenantSiteContext`. Prepare nullable
schema, backfill reviewed mappings in bounded batches, verify counts/checksums
and canonical parent equality, activate final constraints, cut over sitemap
artifacts, drain old jobs, and restart workers. The tenant flag is not a
rollback mechanism after activation.

The implementation and proof surfaces are present, but no Content/Sites tenant
readiness claim is made until the deferred package suites, database matrices,
real Redis/concurrency, archive, and sealed-consumer commands have run green.
## P2 complete-graph rehearsal

The sealed production consumer now composes translated Pages, Content placements and snapshots, private Media, reference Metafields, Taxonomy, Forms, Templates, Comments/mentions, Activity, scheduled Mail, and tenant-scoped CSV exports in two tenants with identical business keys, sites, and paths. It also carries legacy vendor/copied migration, role-fanout, shared-binary, platform-history, self-translation, ambiguous-owner, and revoked-token fixture declarations with immutable mapping/configuration hashes and conservation checks.

Implementation is present; the consolidated runtime/database/archive verification is pending. See [configurable tenancy operations](tenancy-operations.md).
