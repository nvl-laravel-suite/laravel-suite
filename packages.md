# NVL Packages

The `nvl/laravel-suite` Composer package contains 22 internal Laravel modules. The installable suite supports PHP 8.4+ and Laravel 13, is headless by default, retains explicit dependency boundaries, and includes module-specific configuration, API, operational, and testing documentation.

## `nvl/activity`

Generic activity capture and readable timelines for Laravel models, built on Spatie Activitylog without application-specific business rules.

- Records structured model activity with subjects, actors, visibility, importance, changed attributes, and safe context.

## `nvl/auth`

A headless, pipeline-driven identity, authentication, and access-control
foundation for applications that retain ownership of their concrete User model.

  devices, sessions, authenticators, invitations, recovery cases, and a
  sanitized security-event ledger.

  templates host-owned.
