# Changelog

All notable changes to `nvl/media` are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-21

- Documented opt-in tenant ownership, independent catalog copies, immutable
  adoption mappings, backup-based recovery, and bounded tenant cleanup.

### Fixed

- Recheck attachment availability and public-reuse visibility on the current
  database row inside the media mutation lock and association transaction.
  Stale model instances can no longer bypass these guards or reject an asset
  that has since become eligible. Existing calls remain compatible; the
  concrete attachment action adds an optional public-visibility requirement.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-29

### Changed

- Established Media Actions, `MediaLibrary`, `MediaQueryService`, and owner
  traits as the 2.0 consumer boundary; direct consumer Media-model queries and
  relation aggregates now fail Suite audit.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Added an exact active-association query boundary for owner packages that need
  association-scoped projections or delivery without querying Media internals.
- Added an explicit local command and disposable-service contract for the
  PostgreSQL, Redis, and S3-compatible multipart recovery proof.

### Changed

- Aligned production support and quality guidance with the PHP 8.4+ runtime
  baseline and local production-stack verification workflow.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- Added a missing-binary incident recovery runbook and verified explicit,
  shared-lock multipart scheduler ownership guidance.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- Released unchanged under the suite's shared version after the v1.0.2 Media
  hardening work.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-12

- Replaced the global media-hash uniqueness constraint with an indexed reusable hash, added generated-binary ingestion, existence-safe nullable URLs, one-record cross-disk relocation, and a single PUT/PATCH management route declaration.
- Added dry-run-first `nvl:media:adopt-spatie` conversion with deterministic identifiers, association/translation/variation mapping, backing-path and count reconciliation, plus Doctor checks and empty-root guidance for in-place storage adoption.
- Registered migration publication through Laravel's timestamp-aware API and made Doctor warn when automatic vendor loading overlaps a published host copy.
- Fixed the Spatie-compatible granular permission fallback so Eloquent's
  dynamic method proxy cannot prevent `hasPermissionTo` from being evaluated.
- Allowed association detachment from soft-deleted Media tombstones so owning
  domains can complete privacy and lifecycle cleanup without deleting Media.
- Added complete PHP, HTTP, configuration, and extension/event references, including every model-trait/facade/adder/slot/conversion method, management endpoint, DTO boundary, status/error shape, configuration group/environment variable, binding contract, lifecycle event, and operational log category; added automated documentation-drift coverage.
- Added an injectable `MediaLibraryContract` and `Nvl\Media\Facades\Media` for fluent source ingestion, scoped reads, associations, lifecycle mutations, scan finalization, authorization checks, and persisted multipart operations without duplicating action logic.
- Made upload, attach, detach, delete, and public-reuse contract overrides apply consistently across the model trait, fluent adder, lifecycle services, package controllers, and facade.
- Added `MediaAdder::usingSlot()` so model and facade upload builders share one fluent slot-selection path.
- Added the documented `media-migrations` publish tag.
- Added one authoritative byte-detected ingestion pipeline for uploads, replacements, requests, local/disk/base64/remote sources, and scanner-attested multipart finalization.
- Added extension-to-MIME alias lists, dangerous multi-extension rejection, canonical opaque object names, synchronous scanner enforcement, and stored size/SHA-256 verification.
- Added root-transaction-aware storage effects, recoverable post-commit cleanup, Redis/cache mutation locks, sorted bulk locking, copy–verify–swap moves, soft-delete tombstones, and revision-safe immutable variation replacement.
- Added bounded temporary-file ownership, streamed disk/base64 sources, DNS-pinned cURL remote fetching, redirect revalidation, connected-IP verification, and configurable SSRF/time/byte boundaries.
- Implemented persisted upload-specific named variations, explicit deduplication conflict handling, deterministic replacement/regeneration, and full `withoutVariations()` suppression.
- Added persisted encrypted multipart sessions, first-party recoverable S3-compatible multipart support, checksummed fixed-size parts, idempotent completion/abort/recovery, `MediaScanResultData`, and expired-session pruning. Multipart is opt-in and production-gated by recoverability, central locks, scanner attestation, and the PostgreSQL/Redis/S3 integration suite.
- Added orphan inventory and protected explicit cleanup to `nvl:media:reconcile`, plus structured storage, integrity, scanner, remote-source, stale-work, and multipart recovery diagnostics.
- Added production configuration groups, `MediaSearchDriver`, a page-size cap, listing indexes, focused controllers, and expanded `nvl:media:doctor --production` checks.
- Added an optional Spatie Permission-compatible global role and granular permission bridge for consistent cross-owner listing, delivery, mutation, and deletion; role names remain opt-in and failures fall back to ownership.
- Made remote URL ingestion opt-in so ordinary uploads do not incur DNS/cURL policy, while retaining pinned, connected-IP-attested fetching whenever the capability is enabled.
- Removed boolean scan finalization, client-authoritative multipart mutation fields, dynamic transformation configuration, `MediaTransformationConfig`, the compatibility API controller, and model tag-mutation wrappers from the clean v1 surface.
- Consolidated lifecycle, uploader, deduplication, association, variation, and localized-metadata schema into the clean-install create migrations.
- Standardized the localized-metadata table as `px_media_i18n`.
- Added first-class S3 Flysystem support with private-at-rest ACL-safe defaults, explicit visibility handling, streamed cross-disk copies, and no folder-marker writes.
- Added enum-driven WebP/AVIF format profiles, configurable compression/quality, proportional max-size resizing, three overrideable presets, and safe configurable variation filenames.
- Added complete queued-conversion payload parity, per-job retry/timeout/backoff/uniqueness configuration, source-revision protection, and terminal failure reporting.
- Extended the doctor with S3, image driver/encoder, and queue timeout diagnostics.
- Added dedicated S3, image/queue, and command operations guides.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-08

- Added private one-to-one media and reusable public assets with policy-bounded deduplication.
- Added proxied and multipart uploads, checksums, scanning, quarantine, lifecycle states, and idempotent finalization.
- Added authorized GET/HEAD/range delivery, asynchronous variations, localized metadata, and reconciliation.
- Removed consumer-specific contracts, legacy APIs, concrete user assumptions, and internal-path exposure.

<!-- tenancy-program-p2 -->
Configurable-tenancy implementation and adoption documentation are present. The final consolidated verification matrix is pending; do not treat this package as release-ready until that gate passes.
