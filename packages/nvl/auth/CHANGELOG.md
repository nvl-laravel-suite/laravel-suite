# Changelog

All notable changes to `nvl/auth` are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.1] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Released unchanged under the suite's shared version.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-29

### Changed

- Changed role and permission management list items from Eloquent models to
  `RoleListItemData` and `PermissionListItemData` while preserving paginator
  metadata, authorization, counts, and ordering.
- Established the bounded Auth Actions and authorization contracts as the 2.0
  consumer boundary; direct consumer Auth-model queries now fail Suite audit.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Added a privacy-bounded, after-commit `InvitationAccepted` event for direct
  and registration-through-invitation acceptance paths.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Preserved application-defined `$fillable` attributes on User subclasses while
  merging the configured canonical principal columns, normalizing duplicates,
  and keeping unlisted attributes protected.

### Changed

- Documented host principal extension fields and sensitive self-service profile
  confirmation for email changes.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Restored the v1.0.1 Auth create-migration schema and added a forward-only,
  idempotent corrective migration for invitation `context_hash` and challenge
  `secondary_secret_hash` columns and indexes. Schema planning now reports and
  repairs incomplete enabled-feature tables, Doctor verifies both indexes, and
  the release workflow rehearses a real v1.0.1-to-v1.0.3 upgrade.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- Registered migration publication through Laravel's timestamp-aware API and
  made Doctor warn when automatic vendor loading overlaps a published host copy.
- Added versioned, dry-run-first legacy principal adoption with staging,
  password-reset-token preservation, extension columns, host foreign-key
  reconciliation, bounded validation, and explicit source cleanup.
- Added canonical-to-physical principal attribute mapping across the package
  model, Actions, validation, authentication metadata, and diagnostics.
- Made Auth migrations feature-aware and idempotent, with a schema planning and
  reconciliation command for features enabled after initial installation.
- Made Doctor reject physical principal columns that shadow Eloquent
  relationships on the configured User model.
- Made principal create/update Actions persist complete validated DTO payloads
  through the attribute mapper; update DTOs use `Optional` so omitted fields
  remain unchanged while explicit values are applied without duplicate wiring.
- Added replaceable authentication eligibility and account-confirmation
  contracts across credential, passwordless, social, password-reset, profile,
  and self-service deletion flows. Successful login metadata now records only
  after host policy and the login pipeline accept the subject.
- Added fail-closed Socialite verified-email provenance, atomic sparse email
  changes with verification restart, and complete self-delete session/token
  containment.
- Added explicitly authorized actorless invitation issuance, bounded expiry and
  return-path context, atomic invitation registration, exact blind-index
  filters, and replaceable registration mapping for host fields.
- Added compound magic-link challenges with one single-use link token and
  numeric fallback code plus direct challenge-ID callbacks. Delivery requests
  now reject feature/message-type mismatches.
- Decoupled RBAC principal lookup and assignment from package principal
  management through `RbacPrincipalAccess`; role and permission replacement
  Actions now consume validated DTOs and emit `RbacAssignmentChanged` from the
  common assignment boundary, including creation and invitation grants.
- Added validated rich role templates with display, description, system,
  hierarchy, priority, metadata, and caller-selected target-role support.
- Added `BootstrapRbacAction`, deterministic synchronization reports, and a
  denied-by-default `SystemMutationAccess` boundary for traceable actorless
  bootstrap, domain RBAC, and principal lifecycle transitions.
- Added replaceable `PrincipalSessionContainment` across disable, delete,
  restore, and bulk lifecycle paths. The Laravel adapter revokes package API
  tokens, rotates remember credentials, and removes database sessions.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-09

### Changed

- Made disabled provider registration passive for host authentication,
  authorization, Sanctum, password-broker, and migration state.
- Added configurable audit persistence and successful-login metadata contracts.
- Added authentication attempt and rejection events, including request-context
  metadata for successful logins.
- Documented the physical schema contract retained by configurable Auth models.
- Rebuilt the package around sixteen independently enabled authentication
  features and one canonical feature/route manifest.
- Added the concrete, extensible package User model with profile, search,
  suggestions, CRUD, restore, enable/disable, bulk operations, and access
  assignment Actions and optional JSON APIs.
- Added package-owned Spatie-compatible Role/Permission models and UUID pivots,
  including CRUD, cloning, hierarchy, templates, analytics, and synchronization.
- Added package-owned Sanctum PersonalAccessToken and password-reset-token
  tables while retaining Sanctum and Laravel provider behavior.
- Namespaced the complete 17-table schema with the `nvl_auth_` prefix.
- Replaced notification and delivery infrastructure with the after-commit
  `AuthDeliveryRequested` event and typed `AuthDeliveryRequest` payload.
- Added fail-closed optional adapters for Sanctum and Socialite, plus a
  maintained built-in WebAuthn passkey ceremony that remains replaceable.
- Added first-party client allowlists and Laravel-session correlation without a
  shadow session implementation.
- Added named host pipelines, route/surface flags, stale-cache middleware,
  readiness diagnostics, feature inventory, and explicit pruning.
- Removed the former delivery, outbox, scheduler, checkpoint, recovery saga,
  principal projection, shadow session, and shadow token architecture.
- Removed unused hard dependencies on NVL data/support, Spatie Data/TypeScript,
  and cron; retained the maintained WebAuthn stack required by built-in passkeys.
- Added Laravel-native password confirmation and transport-independent browser
  session/audit-context ports.
- Added route-only dependency admission so login and passwordless callbacks are
  never registered without the features required to complete their session.
- Added Laravel-native password confirmation, complete client detail/status and
  audit-detail management APIs, transport-independent browser/audit ports, and
  subject-bound public magic-link authentication.
- Made RBAC catalog/template synchronization atomic while retaining granular
  synchronization Actions and enforcing one connection for invitation grants.
- Namespaced Sanctum token names so package operations cannot list, mutate,
  rotate, or revoke host-created personal access tokens.

### Security

- Challenge failures now commit bounded attempt counters before returning.
- Passkey verification receives the stored public key, user handle, signature
  counter, and backup state from package persistence.
- Invitation recipients, TOTP secrets, passkey material, social claims,
  client-session context, and audit context are encrypted at rest.
- Bearer challenges, invitation tokens, recovery codes, client session IDs, and
  provider identifiers use purpose-separated hashes.
- Package HTTP responses now use no-store, no-referrer, and MIME-sniffing
  protection headers; passkey adapter exceptions are normalized at the boundary.
- API-token abilities now deny by default; social-provider failures are neutral;
  provider redirect URLs, audit/delivery payloads, client-session metadata, and
  WebAuthn inputs are bounded.
- Database uniqueness keys enforce one active invitation and one active message
  challenge for their ownership keys; challenge attempts are capped and client
  session correlations cannot be resurrected after termination.
- Passkeys require user verification by default, enforce configurable credential
  limits, validate RP/origin and resident-key policy, use opaque HMAC-derived
  user handles, and use database-portable encrypted storage widths.

### Compatibility

- This is an intentional pre-1.0 configuration and schema break. No compatibility
  shim is provided for the previous overbuilt configuration tree.

<!-- tenancy-program-p2 -->
Configurable-tenancy implementation and adoption documentation are present. The final consolidated verification matrix is pending; do not treat this package as release-ready until that gate passes.
