The NVL Laravel Suite bundles 22 focused Laravel modules and an integration workbench in one Composer package. The modules remain isolated under `packages/nvl`, retain their namespaces, providers, migrations, tests, documentation, and Laravel Boost skills, and ship together under one version.

## Standalone Tenancy foundation

```bash
composer require nvl/tenancy:^2.0
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=tenancy-config
php artisan config:cache
php artisan nvl:tenancy:doctor --json
```

The foundation requires Support and Data, with no NVL Auth dependency. It keeps
tenancy and core migrations disabled until explicitly configured. The archive
consumer gate verifies this minimal profile; a separate explicitly provisioned
Filterable profile proves query composition. Domain adoption is delivered by
subsequent integrations. See the [Tenancy distribution contract](packages/nvl/tenancy/README.md#foundation-distribution-contract).

## Packages and API documentation

Each module has one canonical API and usage page. These pages cover installation,
configuration, primary PHP entry points, optional HTTP surfaces, commands,
extension contracts, operational behavior, and verification where applicable.

See the [package capability catalog](packages.md) for a concise comparison of
all modules. The linked module pages are the source of truth for callable APIs
and integration guidance.

Real consumer defects and adoption gaps are maintained in the
[implementation issue tracker](docs/implementation-issues.md). Its groups are
the required implementation and commit boundaries for follow-up work.

The suite is auto-discoverable and supports Laravel 13 on PHP 8.4+. Module source and configuration must not reference a host `App\`/`Modules\` class or named host middleware. Internal dependency boundaries remain explicit and are validated in CI, but Composer installs and versions only `nvl/laravel-suite`.

## Staged module adoption

The auto-discovered suite provider can register a safe subset of modules. New
installs default to the full suite. Preview a dependency-complete minimal
overlay, explicitly write it after review, and clear the configuration cache:

```bash
php artisan nvl:suite:configure --profile=content-platform --minimal
php artisan nvl:suite:configure --profile=content-platform --minimal --write
php artisan config:clear
```

The command is dry-run-first and writes only with `--write`; replacing a file
also requires `--force` and returns a unified diff. `--add` and `--remove`
compose capability roots around a profile. Use `--full` when an explicit map of
all twenty-two booleans is preferable. Publishing the unmodified full-suite default
remains available with `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=suite-config`.

Configure `config/nvl-suite.php` before running migrations. Including a module
automatically registers its transitive NVL dependencies in canonical order; it
does not enable unrelated modules. For example, including only `auth` registers
`support`, `data`, then `auth`.

Use the documented [installation profiles](docs/installation-profiles.md) for
auth-only, content-platform, communications, or full-suite adoption. The
[suite adoption matrix](docs/adoption-matrix.md) records migration ownership,
queues, scheduler entries, replaceable contracts, aliases, TypeScript output,
and Doctor coverage for every module.

Inspect the effective runtime without dumping arbitrary configuration or
secrets, then run every enabled package Doctor through the root readiness gate:

```bash
php artisan nvl:suite:configuration --profile=auth-only
php artisan nvl:suite:configuration --format=json
php artisan nvl:suite:upgrade:check --strict
php artisan nvl:suite:consumer-audit --strict
php artisan nvl:suite:doctor --strict
php artisan nvl:suite:doctor --production --strict --format=json
```

The configuration report shows requested and dependency-enabled modules,
loaded providers, migration ownership, resolved boundary implementations,
registered aliases, queue responsibilities, scheduler status, TypeScript
participation, and Doctor commands. Production Doctor mode also rejects debug
mode, a missing application key, and missing host scheduler entries required by
enabled Mail Notifications or Media features.

When package discovery itself must be disabled, register
`Nvl\Data\Providers\DataServiceProvider` before
`Nvl\Auth\Providers\AuthServiceProvider`. Auth also registers its Data
foundation defensively, so direct Auth-only registration remains supported.

### Scheduler ownership

Scheduler ownership is explicit and feature-gated:

- Activity registers `nvl:activity:purge-system` itself only when
  `activity.retention.schedule.enabled=true`.
- Mail Notifications never chooses a cadence. When
  `mail-notifications.scheduling.enabled=true`, the host schedules both bounded
  processing commands.
- Media reconciliation is diagnostic and must not be automated as cleanup.
  When `media.multipart.enabled=true`, the host schedules multipart pruning.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;

Schedule::command('nvl:mail-notifications:process-scheduled')
    ->everyMinute()
    ->onOneServer()
    ->withoutOverlapping();

Schedule::command('nvl:mail-notifications:recover-scheduled')
    ->everyMinute()
    ->onOneServer()
    ->withoutOverlapping();

Schedule::command('nvl:media:multipart:prune')
    ->everyFiveMinutes()
    ->onOneServer()
    ->withoutOverlapping();
```

Only install the Mail Notifications entries when scheduling is enabled and the
Media entry when multipart is enabled. Readiness checks apply their matching
schedule requirements only when that feature is enabled. Copy current package
command names from these guides; never restore removed host command names.
Laravel's scheduler mutex cache must be a shared lock store across every node;
both `onOneServer()` and `withoutOverlapping()` depend on that shared backend.

### SQLite adoption constraints

SQLite may rebuild a table while a host adoption migration drops and restores
foreign keys. That rebuild can discard enum-style `CHECK` constraints or
equivalent triggers. A corrective adoption migration must restore the final
schema contract: the original create-migration values plus every later status
expansion, not merely the original list. Prove the rebuilt schema by asserting
that an invalid raw status write throws `QueryException` and that every current
enum case remains writable, including later additions such as `expired`.

## Composer installation

Install a stable suite release from [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/nvl/laravel-suite):

```bash
composer require nvl/laravel-suite:^2.0
```

Composer installs the clean distribution archive for the selected tag by
default. A normal installation does not clone the development repository.

When intentionally testing the development branch, require the Packagist
development version explicitly:

```bash
composer require nvl/laravel-suite:dev-main
```

No custom Composer repository entry is required.

One `vX.Y.Z` tag versions every internal module and produces one release archive.

### Dependency-major preflight

Suite v1 installs `spatie/typescript-transformer` and
`spatie/laravel-typescript-transformer` 3.3. Consumers upgrading from v2 must
remove `RecordTypeScriptType` and use
`LiteralTypeScriptType('Record<string, unknown>')` (or a narrower record shape).
Version 3 also removed v2 writer APIs such as `SplitWriter`; NVL Data owns split
declaration output through its configured writer. Run static analysis and both
`nvl:data:types:generate` and `nvl:data:types:check` immediately after Composer
changes. Do not rely on packages that happened to be installed transitively by
the previous transformer version; declare every directly used package.

## Repository and distribution contents

The `main` branch is the maintainable source repository. It intentionally keeps
the integration workbench, tests, fixtures, static-analysis configuration,
lockfiles, and GitHub Actions needed to verify releases. Repository-local AI,
MCP, and editor configuration is ignored and is not part of the tracked source.

Stable version tags are built from the verified Composer archive. Packagist
consumers receive only the root manifest, license, changelogs and documentation,
the suite provider, and runtime contents under `packages/nvl`; development
workbench configuration, tests, fixtures, and repository tooling are not
included.

## Translation architecture

`nvl/translatable` is the single runtime for model-backed content:

- Metafield definitions and eligible owner values use dedicated translation rows.
- Media title, alternative text, and caption use dedicated translation rows.
- Taxonomy name and description use `terms_i18n`.
- Form name, description, submit/success copy, and arbitrary nested content use `forms_i18n`.
- Schema-driven Content block fields use `content_blocks_i18n`.
- Laravel language files remain responsible for interface strings and validation messages.

The central `TranslationResourceRegistry` gathers Forms, Media, Metafields, SEO, Taxonomy, and application resources from one place. Use `php artisan nvl:translatable:gather --json` for catalog/coverage output.

Read [the translation architecture and rollout guide](docs/translation-architecture.md) before adding another translated model or adopting an existing localized schema.

## Local setup

```bash
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
```

The root `composer.json` is both the published package manifest and the local workbench manifest. The `Nvl\Workbench` namespace keeps local application fixtures separate from consumer `App\` namespaces.

Laravel Herd serves this workspace automatically; do not start a separate PHP development server.

## Development rules

- Keep changes within the owning module and follow its established architecture and naming conventions.
- Keep Controllers as HTTP adapters, Actions as transaction owners, Services as focused collaborators, Models lean, and DTOs explicit.
- Add a migration instead of editing a migration that may already be deployed.
- Add or update Pest coverage for every behavior change.
- CI holds each package at its measured coverage baseline, requires 90% line
  coverage for newly changed source lines on pull requests and branch pushes,
  and ratchets package baselines upward as tests improve.
- Keep module boundaries and external dependencies declared directly and bounded.
- Keep the v1 API free of pre-release aliases; document breaking upgrades explicitly.
- Use package Actions and Services from consumers; do not reach into persistence internals.

## Tests and formatting

Run one focused package:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest \
    --test-directory=packages/nvl/forms/tests \
    --configuration=packages/nvl/forms/phpunit.xml.dist \
    --bootstrap=vendor/autoload.php \
    --compact \
    packages/nvl/forms/tests
```

Run the full monorepo with enough memory for Media binary fixtures:

```bash
composer quality
```

The root quality gate checks formatting, Larastan/PHPStan at maximum strictness,
declared module and extension dependencies, suite architecture/distribution
rules, the frozen public contracts, generated TypeScript freshness and
compilation, and the complete Pest suite with a 1 GB memory limit. The root
integration suite is an executable reference
consumer: one application model composes Activity, Comments, Content, Media,
Metafields, SEO, and Taxonomy and exercises the shared registries, strict
doctors, and a constant eager-loading query budget. Module-specific test suites
remain independently runnable through their `phpunit.xml.dist` files.

Public and protected extension contracts, command signatures, provider
discovery, publish tags, autoload files, configuration, routes, and migrations
are recorded in `tools/package-contracts.json`. Compatibility checks fail when
that surface moves unexpectedly:

```bash
composer contracts:check
composer contracts:update
```

Only run `contracts:update` after reviewing the semantic-version impact of an
intentional contract change.

During development, format only changed PHP or validate one manifest with:

```bash
vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent
composer validate --strict packages/nvl/forms/composer.json
```

## Agent skills

Each module provider exposes its skill directory through a stable `*-skills` publish tag. Modules use the Laravel Boost layout:

```text
resources/boost/skills/<skill-name>/
├── SKILL.md
└── agents/openai.yaml
```

Laravel Boost discovers every suite skill directly from the installed dependency:

```bash
php artisan boost:install --skills
```

The suite archive mirrors the 20 canonical package skills under its root
`resources/boost/skills` directory for native dependency discovery. The family
validator rejects any mirror drift.

For a Suite application, publish every effective module skill—including
transitive module dependencies—with one managed command:

```bash
php artisan nvl:suite:skills:publish
```

The command writes `.agents/skills/.nvl-suite-skills.json`. That manifest records
the owning package, installed Suite version, module, directory, and SHA-256 hash
of every managed file. Updates follow these ownership rules:

- missing Suite skills are installed;
- byte-identical existing Suite skills are adopted into the manifest;
- unmodified manifest-owned skills are updated;
- locally modified manifest-owned skills stop with a conflict unless
  `--force` is passed;
- unmanaged directories are never overwritten, including by `--force`, and
  unrelated application-authored skills are never inspected or changed.

Check ownership, version, missing skills, local modifications, and packaged
source drift without writing any files:

```bash
php artisan nvl:suite:skills:doctor --strict
php artisan nvl:suite:skills:doctor --strict --format=json
```

The aggregate Laravel publication tag also resolves only effective modules:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=suite-skills
```

Laravel's generic publisher cannot generate the application-specific ownership
manifest. After using the tag for initial materialization, run
`nvl:suite:skills:publish` once to adopt byte-identical directories. Use the
managed command—not `vendor:publish --force`—for later updates.

To install one module skill without running Boost discovery or aggregate Suite
publication, its individual tag remains available:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=forms-skills
```

Available package skill tags are:

- `activity-skills`
- `auth-skills`
- `comments-skills`
- `content-skills`
- `csv-skills`
- `data-skills`
- `filterable-skills`
- `forms-skills`
- `mail-notifications-skills`
- `media-skills`
- `metafields-skills`
- `pages-skills`
- `tasks-skills`
- `primitives-skills`
- `seo-skills`
- `settings-skills`
- `support-skills`
- `tenancy-skills`
- `taxonomy-skills`
- `templates-skills`
- `translatable-skills`
- `translations-skills`

Skill sources must describe current package code, validate with the Codex skill validator, and avoid historical namespaces or proposed architectures.

Every package provides its canonical `nvl-*` skill. Tenancy also ships the
backend execution skill required by its staged rollout. Historical top-level
skill directories and future-proposal guidance are rejected by the family
validator.

## Generated TypeScript contracts

Modules that expose DTO or enum contracts register their source paths with the Data module; infrastructure-only modules do not acquire a data dependency just for discovery. Applications may add their own paths in `config/nvl-data.php`. Generate declarations during build:

```bash
php artisan nvl:data:types:generate --fail-on-warning
php artisan nvl:data:types:check --fail-on-warning
php artisan nvl:data:types:manifest
npm run types:check
```

The explicit strict flags are available in suite 1.0.2 and later. Generated
declarations should be excluded from ESLint and Prettier; Data publishes the
canonical ignore fragments with the `nvl-data-generated-types-tooling` tag.

The opt-in generated-type surface serves only manifest-listed, pre-generated
artifacts and a bounded streamed archive. It is disabled by default, protected
by configured middleware when enabled, and never generates during a request.

## Release workflow

The canonical [push, automated tagging, and release guide](docs/releasing.md)
covers preparation, explicit staging, local gates, pushing `main`, dispatching
the release workflow, Packagist synchronization, clean-consumer verification,
and safe retry rules.

The short path is:

```bash
composer quality
composer validate --strict
composer audit --locked --no-interaction
git add <reviewed-paths>
git diff --cached
git commit -m "release: prepare v2.0.0"
git push origin main

gh workflow run package-release.yml --ref main -f version=2.0.0
```

Wait for the six `Package quality` jobs to pass before dispatching `Package
release`. Supply `2.0.0`, not `v2.0.0`. The release workflow reruns those gates
and requires its PHP 8.5, archive, prepared-final-1.x, and Auth/Content proof
consumer jobs before publication. Never create or push a version tag manually:
the workflow builds and installs the clean archive, creates the annotated
`v2.0.0` tag, publishes the GitHub Release, and lets Packagist discover the
stable version.

Do not publish `dev-main` as a stable dependency. Consumers should use the `^2.0` line.
Choose one migration owner per application. Automatic vendor loading is the
default. Host-owned migrations must be published before the first migration,
with every relevant `<package>.migrations.enabled` setting changed to `false`;
Laravel retimestamps published migrations, so the two modes must never run
together against one database.

### Tenancy activation

Tenancy provider selection does not enable its feature or migrations. Suite
configuration reports ownership and effective connections separately from schema
readiness; `nvl:tenancy:doctor --json` checks actual storage. Enabled tenant entry
and adoption activation reject loaded runtime packages whose real tenancy
integrations have not shipped. An incomplete composition can still boot for
Unresolved diagnostics and explicitly admitted platform bootstrap. See
[Tenancy readiness and migration ownership](packages/nvl/tenancy/README.md#runtime-compatibility-and-readiness).

<!-- tenancy-program-p2 -->
The configurable-tenancy program implementation covered the original 21 distributions, including adoption, lifecycle, sealed-consumer, and release-gate surfaces. Tasks adds its own tenant adoption and isolation tests; this statement is not a release-readiness claim.
